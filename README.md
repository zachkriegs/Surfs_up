## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to show the difference in weather between the months June and December in Oahu, HI. This analysis will be used to determine weather a surf and ice cream shop would be viable in Oahu. 
## Results
-There were three major differences in the weather for June vs December
    - It is almost 4 degrees warmer on average in June than in December.
    - The minimum temperature can be up to 8 degrees colder in December than in June.
    - The maximum temperature in both June and December is very similar, with only a two degree difference.
## Summary 
The results show that while it is warmer on average in June than it is in December, the weather still remains above 65 degrees on average 75% of the time in both months, making it ideal weather for the ice cream and surf shop. Two other queries that would be beneficial to the analysis would be to compare the average rainfall of each month to determine if one month gets more rain than another. The other would be to determine the amount of days it rains each month, to see if the rainfall was spread out over many days or concentrated in a few.
